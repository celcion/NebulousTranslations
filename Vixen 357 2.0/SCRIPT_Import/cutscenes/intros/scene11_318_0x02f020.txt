    -- Watchtower Offensive --

    Merisma Harp has suffered
    heavy losses from the Nuke
   Wave, but managed to acquire
   a new ally: Kiel Royard, who
  switched sides in the previous
   battle. Slash team is not yet
    ready to trust Kiel, so he
     leads them to one of the
        enemy's outposts.
