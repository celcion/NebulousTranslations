       -- Kiel, again --

 After defeating the detached
enemy force, Slash team returns
to the base in order to defend
 it from the incoming attack.
There they find Colonel Kiel's
  force, reduced to half its
original size; but even in this
      condition, they have
     a significant military
           advantage.
