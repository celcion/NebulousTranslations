 Arc Palace: that is the enemy.
 HQ has ordered to attack their
  base from the sea; for this
  reason, they have decided to
   give Slash the amphibious
   VECTOR "Namoon." The team
 heads for the secret facility
  near the shore in order to
   receive their new VECTOR;
  however, they find an enemy
   squadron waiting for them.
