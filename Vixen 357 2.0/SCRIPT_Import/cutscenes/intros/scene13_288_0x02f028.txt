      -- VECTOR factory --

   After finally reaching the
   VECTOR factory, Slash team
  investigates the surrounding
 area and notices that there is
 only one possible entry point.
 However, the entry is guarded
 by Moore, the bravest officer
of the Four Grand Arcs, who has
  already planned a defensive
            strategy.
