 The war of 2384 against the
aliens ended with a narrow
victory of the Earth. One of
the major contributors to
victory was the high-mobility
humanoid weapon system "SERD"
developed in secret by the
Asian Federation.

 After several years...
The wounds from the war had
healed, and Earth was once
again divided into multiple
nations of different races.

 Various countries began
researching and developing
their own SERDs; officially
in order to prevent a new
war against the aliens, but
in truth they wanted powerful
weapons to keep their neighbors
in check.

 During this arms race, a weapon
that surpassed the performance
of the SERDs was finally
developed: the VECTOR.

 Contrarily to the previous
generation, VECTORs are able to
equip different weapons in order
to deal with any situation;
furthermore, the controls of
each individual unit have been
simplified, thus allowing to
pilot different models without
requiring additional training.



 It is now year 2396.
Merisma Harp, one of the
recently created countries,
has developed its own VECTORs.
A special task force called
"Slash" was formed in order to
test the latest prototypes.
And so, VECTORs were finally
thrown into real combat.

 While Takuya and the rest of
Slash were out of HQ for
a combat exercise, an unknown
VECTOR squadron emerged from the
nearby forest. As soon as they
were notified of the enemy raid,
Takuya and the others hurried
back to the base.
When they finally arrived, the
garrison was already engaging
the enemy force.
