 
25th century.
 
A new era of space travel
began, and humanity expanded
its influence to neighboring
star systems.
 
Coincidentally, as a result
of this expansion, the
federal government of Earth
contacted the Galactic
Council, an alien
organization of states that
wished for the development
and peace for mankind.
Humanity engaged in
a friendly alliance with the
Galactic Council, but the
dissatisfaction with the
current administration on
Earth was pretty serious as
a result.
 
Some people strongly opposed
to the peace treaty staged
a rebellion.
The rebellion only had
a local reach and was
immediately suppressed.
However, the fate of its
leader, "Geist Nidoman",
remains unknown.
 
In the quickly expanding
nova system, the federal
government was unable to
maintain the security
control and it became rife
with criminals, coming from
the frontier systems.
 
In the meantime, an
organization called VOID
became a serious threat,
sweeping all over the human
domain. People nicknamed its
leader the "Dark Champion",
out of fear and despair.
The rise of this unknown
organization seemed to be
a beginning of a new dark
era.
 
This is the story of the
hunters who stood bravely
in the face of this huge
evil...
