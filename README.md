# Nebulous Translations

This is the Github page of Nebulous Translations where you can access files from our projects and thus help develop the beautiful hobby of ROMhacking by actively participating in our work.

Please, keep in mind that I'm (<i>Celcion</i>) not a programmer, so my code could be pretty ugly. But as long as it does its job, it doesn't matter, right? :-)
I also use <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">Powershell</a> for the most part. It's not the sole programming language I know, but the one I'm most comfortable with. Note that this code was written using <b>Windows version</b> of Powershell. I can't guarantee that it'll work on Linux/macOS versions.

Also we'd like to note that we prefer to keep information about future and ongoing projects closed. So please don't ask us which games we're working on currently and which games will be next. Source code will also be published post-release only.
