# Nebulous Translations

This is the Github page of Nebulous Translations where you can access files from our projects and thus help develop the beautiful hobby of ROMhacking by actively participating in our work.

Please, keep in mind that I'm (<i>Celcion</i>) not a programmer, so my code could be pretty ugly. But as long as it does its job, it doesn't matter, right? :-)
I also use <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell">Powershell</a> for the most part. It's not the sole programming language I know, but the one I'm most comfortable with. Note that this code was written using <b>Windows version</b> of Powershell. I can't guarantee that it'll work on Linux/macOS versions. UPDATE: It's Ruby now, so you can at least try to check the sources without barf bag. :-)

Also we'd like to note that we prefer to keep information about future and ongoing projects closed. So please don't ask us which games we're working on currently and which games will be next. Source code will also be published post-release only.

<h2>Page news:</h2>

<b><i>04 Dec 2022</i></b> - Yet another "better late than never" addition is... Vixen 357 once again. But, wait, you'd say, Vixen 357 was added an ages ago! Sure it was, but this is a newer and much better crafted version of translation that we were preparing for a very special release. It was done with much better tooling, used a much better approach as a whole (like, in-game compression engine was reused for text that was previously inserted with ROM expansion). Sadly, nothing came out the cause we were making it for, so all these efforts ended up being useless. So, I figured, it would be better to put it here rather than just delete it. I guess there's no point in releasing the translation itself since changes aren't very visible from a gamer perspective (changed fonts, some small fixes here and there, other minor stuff), but feel free to use these tools to make a translated ROM yourself!

<b><i>05 Jun 2019</i></b> - Star Cruiser x68k project files are finally here! Better late than never!

<b><i>02 Feb 2019</i></b> - Added project files for The Game of Life RPG translation. It's been a while!

<b><i>19 Mar 2018</i></b> - Added project files for War of the Dead (better late than never!) and Getsu Fuma Den translations. Tools for both translations were written in Ruby. Getsu Fuma Den project contains a our new minimalistic assembler/disassembler also written in Ruby.

<b><i>10 Oct 2017</i></b> - The second and long awaited release, Star Cruiser II is here!

<b><i>06 Jul 2017</i></b> - Our first release this year, The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Skull Leader Complete Pack (nice and short name, yeah), but surely not the last! Stay tuned for more!

<b><i>12 Dec 2016</i></b> - Files for Vixen 357, our second translation - is also here! This was more involved work in terms of hacking, but code quality is still can be considered poor.

<b><i>09 Dec 2016</i></b> - Our first translation, Star Cruiser - is here! But as it was my first attempt to make a translation of this complexity level, code quality is very poor, please be aware.

<b><i>07 Dec 2016</i></b> - Recently released Out Live translation files released!

<b><i>05 Dec 2016</i></b> - Saiyuuki World files are up! More to come. Stay tuned! :-)
